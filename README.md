# Isles2017-InterviewProject
This was the project I chose to do for the Isles Softworks recruitment process in March 2017.

What I need to improve on:
* Adding a README to my projects describing what it is, how to install and the requirements.
* Adding JavaDocs to my projects as I code, even if they take time.
* Commenting everything possible to explain what I'm thinking for any further references.
